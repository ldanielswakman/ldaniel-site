<p>In architecture, a parti describes the central organising idea of a building’s design; expressed in a basic diagram.
This represents the way I approach design: synthesising information into a clearly legible product that translates the message not only through its content, but even its initial appearance.</p>
<br />
<p>
In essence, content and its representation are highly interwoven; good visual design celebrates his link.
ldaniel.eu is a graphic and web design office, aimed at meaningful design of content and information. I have been working on a variety of projects for the past 5 years in the disciplines of graphic design, web design, branding & information visualisation.<br/><br />

Currently I’m located in Istanbul, TR.
