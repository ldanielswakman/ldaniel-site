    Upon meeting Can – the founder of the
    project – at Brew Lab around
    Galatasaray, it quickly became clear he
    had something going. In the past months,
    he had built up a community around
    organising culinary evenings, where
    talented chefs provide food and
    explanation to interested people.

    ### **drawing not just a chef's hat**
    <br />
    As a new platform bringing together people that have a passion for food with the chefs that make it, the iconography of a chef’s hat was written all over it. While loosely jotting down associations to the brief that had been set, three values started surfacing:
    <br />
    - wine tasting events
    - signature: a chef ‘signing’ his work
    - clear iconography
