    <h3 class="u-mt60 u-mb20">identity</h3>
    As a result of a multi-year PhD research on a personalised learning tool, the cover needed to reflect the look of the (link: http://www.mathsgarden.com/ text: Math Garden popup:yes) application (a garden in which children play mathematical games), but have a distinct identity that would stand on its own.

    In order to achieve a unique tactual experience, 300g/m2 Kraftliner paper was used - a product more often used in the package industry than in scientific dissertation publishing.

    The garden graphic is abstracted by only using horizontal line patterns and a teal color accent. The line texture is repeated on the inside of the cover.
