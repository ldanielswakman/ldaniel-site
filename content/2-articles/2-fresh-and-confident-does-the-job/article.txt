I was invited by a new startup/startup-in-residence focusing on a job matching algorithm, to come up with a strong platform identity for their platform. Not beating around the bush, we got to work and formed the brief around the core sentence:

> “The goal is to create an overall design identity for the SuperCV platform that highlights the unique technology to a global user group.“

The initial proposal for the brand identity rooted in the search for a clear iconic expression that would signal the algorithm ‘machine’ and the behind-the-scenes matching that was being done — combined with a colour scheme that would invoke innovation and trust.

Those keywords were reflected in a basic colour palette of fluorescent cyan (being the fresh innovative side) contrasted with a marine blue (being the confident and trustworthy side.

With a clear idea for this direction, combined with a reflection of this core palette into mockups for landing pages, a concept for the app UI, and promotional material, I set out with my slide deck to the design concept meeting.

It was one of the more interesting meetings I have been to in my experience of dealing with clients; the 6 or 7 people attending obviously were interested in my approach, really liked the general direction, but were not sure about such a bold colour palette and identity. The doubt was palpable.

The initial feedback moment with the product manager was “we are going to look for another designer”. As the client, this was their privilege, of course. But a few days later, they asked if I would be open to revising the colour palette, and moving on with the UI for the project. Progress!

But the colour had to change.
