    Inflight VR is a startup doing what it says on the box, albeit futuristic and ambitious: coming up with an immersive VR entertainment experience in passenger airplane flights. They approached me at the start of 2017 to bring a user experience design angle to the table for the first iterations of the platform.

    A key part of the project at this stage was to explore and define the *constraints and opportunities* of working with VR — the fact that it is such a new medium blows the field of options wide open. I came up with a few categories to frame my research, applying both to the physical context of being in an airplane, as well as being fully immersed in a digital world: **Viewing & Angles**, **Input**, **Menu/interface**, and **Experience**.

  col_1: 'We came up with an interface concept that emphasises the spatial character of the interface, while still preserving a sense of familiarity for the user. We drew inspiration from the multidirectional way of scrolling as seen on the (link: https://www.apple.com/watch/ text: Apple Watch target:_blank), coming up with a dynamic layout that encourages exploration. To be able to provide consistency throughout the interface and between different apps, a bottom system menu was introduced that is always reachable.'
